            <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
              <p>ARGComFest is a weekend comedy festival of Fringe previews and work-in-progress shows that takes place every summer. The festival brings an attentively curated programme of over sixty comedians &mdash; from big name TV favourites to up-and-coming newcomers &mdash; to the labyrinthine settings of Shoreditch Town Hall.</p>
              <p>Returning this year following a sold-out show in 2022, ARG and Shoreditch Town Hall present <a href="https://argcomfest.com/friday" target="_blank" class="external"><b>The Friday Night Show</b></a> &mdash; a spectacular, star-studded showcase of comedians at the top of their game! This year&apos;s blockbuster bill is hosted by <b>Olga Koch</b> and features <b>Nish Kumar</b>, <b>Alison Spittle</b>, <b>Janine Harouni</b> and <b>Bridget Christie</b> &mdash; with even more to be announced.</p>
              <p>Our festival programme celebrates and attracts diversity in all its forms. ARG is committed to making live comedy more accessible and inclusive and this year&apos;s programme features <a href="https://argcomfest.com/access" target="_blank" class="external">live captioned performances</a> throughout the weekend.</p>
            
            <h3 id="programme">Programme</h3>
              <p>This year&apos;s festival features former <i>Mash Report</i> host and two-time Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee <b>Nish Kumar</b>; Writers Guild Award winner for Best Radio Comedy <b>Olga Koch</b>; and 2023 <i>Taskmaster</i> star and <i>Off Menu</i> self-doxxer <b>Ivo Graham</b>.</p>

              <p>We&apos;re presenting hotly anticipated debuts including <b>Priya Hall&apos;s</b> show Grandmother&apos;s Daughter &mdash; a joyful tribute to one old Welsh lady and the impossible standards Priya has to live up to as she prepares to become a matriarch of her own family; <b>Lulu Popplewell</b> exploring the links between <i>Love Actually</i>, smoking crack, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and sunburn; <b>Freya Parker</b> (as seen in sketch duo <i>Lazy Susan</i> and <i>Jurassic World: Dominion</i>) navigating the struggles of trying to remain cheeky when it&apos;s raining trauma; and Welsh, Brown, Gay, Gen-Z comedian <b>Leila Navabi</b> with a show about how unethical it is to artistically exploit marginalised identities for social gain.</p>

              <h3 id="access">Access</h3>
              <p>ARG is committed to making live comedy more accessible and inclusive, and ensuring that live comedy is welcoming to all audiences, artists and staff.</p>
              <p>This year we are delighted to be working with <a href="https://www.clairehillrealtime.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Claire Hill</a>, who will be providing live captioning for a number of performances throughout the festival weekend. Claire has 25 years of experience as a stenographer and has recently captioned James Acaster and Bridget Christie’s national tours.</p>
              <p>Claire will be live captioning <b>The Friday Night Show</b> and half the shows happening in our largest preview space over the weekend. We are aware that this is just a start and keenly understand the importance of including access provision as standard across all our programming. <b>We are proud to see that more venues and promoters are taking accessibility into consideration and as a festival, we are committed to expanding our access offer to include alternative provision (such as British Sign Language) and to cover our whole festival programme by 2028.</b></p>
              <p>We are delivering this year's live captioning without any external funding or subsidy.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>

          <h3 id="history">History</h3>
          <p>In 2012, ARGComFest was founded as a day of comedy across two floors of a pub in King's Cross with two main goals:
          </p><ul>
              <li>to allow people to see the best Fringe shows in London with excellent value tickets &mdash; but still within a Fringe-like atmosphere
              </li>
              <li>to provide comedians with paid previews &mdash; as many acts frequently lose money on previews due to prohibitive venue hire costs
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Over the following years, the festival established a recognisable identity and a strong reputation for a discerning, high-quality programme. It quickly grew: first to a full weekend, then to fill larger venues, and later to a third stage.
          </p>

          <h3 id="social">Social impact</h3>
          <p>As the festival has grown, carving out its position in the comedy calendar along the way, it has become more bold and outspoken about issues facing live comedy and wider society.</p>
          <p>Since 2012, the festival has absorbed booking fees whenever possible (and reduced ticket prices to compensate when not); moved to a significantly more accessible venue; promoted the No More Page 3 campaign; encouraged festival-goers to donate to food banks, LGBTQI+ and domestic violence charities; partnered with local businesses; and kept any ticket price increases well below inflation &mdash; even when adding an extra stage with an accompanying 50% increase in acts.</p>
          <p>ARGComFest was the first major comedy festival to have a gender-balanced programme and it continues to push the boundaries of diversity and representation in live comedy.</p>

          <h2>Other projects</h2>
          <p>From 2018 to 2020, ARG also curated and ran a number of venues at Glasgow International Comedy Festival. This programme included a residency at vegan independent music venue The Hug and Pint, as well as transforming an elegant art gallery into an intimate pop-up comedy venue. ARG will return to GICF in the future.

        <h2>Style guide</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The festival title is always written as either <strong>ARGComFest</strong> (no spaces) or in full as <strong>Actually Rather Good Comedy Festival</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Common mistakes include: adding spaces ('ARGCom Fest'), partially abbreviating ('ARG Comedy Festival'), or missing sections of the title ('ARGFest') &mdash; these are all incorrect and confusing due to similarly named festivals.
          </li>
          <li>Listings often have 'ARGComFest' as the title and the blurb opens with the full name, for example: "Actually Rather Good Comedy Festival is back, bigger than ever!" &mdash; the opposite is also fine.
          </li>
          <li>ARG is the company, ARGComFest is the festival.
          </li>
          <li>The shade of red used for festival branding is PANTONE 186 C, RGB (200,16,46) HEX (C8102E), or CMYK (2,100,85,6).
