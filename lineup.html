									<h3>Preview / work-in-progress shows</h3>
										<p>We have announced 24 shows out of 48 so far. Every single show at the festival is a preview or work-in-progress &mdash; they may be rough around the edges!</p>
										<div id="accordion">
											
											<h4>Rosie Jones: Unapologetic</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/RosieJones.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											“Wickedly Funny” Rosie Jones returns with a brand new show, packed with jokes, mischief and probably, a bit of beef. In this hour, Jones will explore life post COVID, and life post turning thirty. Guaranteed to be naughty, raucous and rip-roaringly fun. Will also include a great story about the Travel Lodge in Croydon.<br/>
											<br/>
											As seen on <i>Live At The Apollo</i>, <i>8 Out Of 10 Cats</i>, <i>Casualty</i> and her own Channel 4 travel show, <i>Trip Hazard</i>.<br/>

											<h4>Phil Wang: The Real Hero in All This</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/PhilWang.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Hot off the heels of his critically acclaimed Netflix special and his first US tour, Phil's bringing his highly infective British-Malaysian variant of comedy to ARG. Phil's last ARG was bloody years ago, so immunity to his charm has faded significantly. Thank goodness he's back with a new hour of absolute gold about race, family and everything that's been going on in his Philly little life. Your doctor called – you&apos;re due your next dose of Wang.<br/>
											<br/>
											“At the top of his game… Inspired work from a comic who just gets better and better" ★★★★★ <i>Time Out</i><br/>

											<h4>Josie Long: Re-enchantment</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/JosieLong.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Josie Long is back with a new show about being humane and hoping for better, and also possibly about learning the trumpet and a flyer she saw in 1991. Since her last show she has moved to Scotland, turned 40 and had another baby and would like these to be seen as professional achievements for tax purposes.<br/>
											<br/>

											<h4>Alison Spittle: WET WIP(e)</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/AlisonSpittle.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Alison loves to do star jumps in the water. She also likes to watch people fight in chip shops. Her two worlds collide as a fight breaks out in aqua-aerobics and she’s never felt so alive.<br/>
											<br/>

											<h4>Jordan Brookes: This Is Just What Happens</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/JordanBrookes.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											What do you do when the end of the world finally comes and you realise it’s going to happen slowly and boringly? No sudden meteor strike. No thrilling zombie apocalypse. Just a gradual ebbing away of life as you knew it. Do you fight to fix things before it gets worse, dedicating your life to making the world around you better? Nah. You close your curtains, hunker down and fixate over something shitty someone said to you two years ago.<br/>
											<br/>

											<h4>Rachel Fairburn: Can I Be Awful?</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/RachelFairburn.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Brassy, abrasive, rude, belligerent. The four horsemen of the apocalypse? No. They’re all words that have been used to describe Rachel and she’s proper sick of it now. She’s also sick of being told to “be kind” by everyone from bearded hipster men to T-shirts. What’s wrong with saying it how you see it? What really is kindness? Why is Rachel’s “truth” not respected? Why are you all so annoying? Probably because nobody tells you that you are. Let Rachel change that.<br/>

											Join the <i>All Killa No Filla</i> co host, as seen on <i>BBC Presents: Stand Up For Live Comedy</i> and <i>Funny Festival Live</i>, part of the BBC’s Festival of Funny. Her TV credit's include <i>Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled</i> and <i>Russell Howard Hour Life Lessons</i>.<br/>

											Helen is basic, well basic-plus because she is self-aware with it.  Last year’s Best Newcomer nominee returns with an hour about self-confidence, self-esteem and self-care. It’s the year of ‘self’. Taking care of yourself has never been more ‘in’. Inspirational quotes and facemasks are a big industry and, like all her friends, Helen is trying to ‘be the change she wants to see’. From <i>Live at The Apollo</i>.<br/>

											<br/>
											Anyway, I'm riding in with some faster horses, give the people what they want I say. As seen on <i>This Time with Alan Partridge</i> (BBC), <i>Stath Lets Flats</i> (Channel 4) and <i>Jonathan Ross' Comedy Club</i><br/>
