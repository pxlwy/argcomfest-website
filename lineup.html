										<h4>Lou Sanders: Shame Pig</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/LouSanders.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Yes, big topics are discussed. Her labia, for one. But also shame, sobriety and unrequested sex. Sanders has met some pigs – and been a mucky little pig herself – and now she’s rolling around in her own filth for your delight.<br/>
										<br/>
										As seen on Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled, The Russell Howard Hour, Comic Relief and heard on Radio 4’s The Unbelievable Truth. Lou has written for 8 Out Of 10 Cats, Mock The Week and Miranda Hart.<br/>

										<h4>Nish Kumar: It's in Your Nature to Destroy Yourselves</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/NishKumar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Double Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee and host of The Mash Report trials new material for a national tour. The title is a quote from Terminator 2. There will be jokes about politics, mankind’s capacity for self-destruction and some jokes that simply don’t work. Come watch someone build something.<br/>
										<br/>
										As seen on Live at the Apollo, Taskmaster, QI and Have I Got News For You.<br/>
										<br/>

										<h4>Elf Lyons: ChiffChaff</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/ElfLyons.png" alt="" /></span>
										The Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee (Best Show 2017) presents her one-woman musical about the economy. You read that right. Let’s get fiscal. The queen of clown is back and she’s making the dismal science fun with a whole orchestra and an Invisible Hand. BBC New Talent Hotlist 2017. Fringe World Best Comedy Show 2018 nominee. British Vogue's '20 Names of Now'.<br/>
										<br/>
										“A fast talking, smart-thinking stand-up for whom the adjective 'kooky' could have been invented for” Guardian<br/>

										<h4>Mark Watson: The Infinite Show</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/MarkWatson.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Cluster-bombed with yoghurt on Taskmaster, half-killed on The Island, Watson returns to what he's best at: being indoors. This show began as a work-in-progress in Edinburgh last year and now makes its official premiere. It's about empathy. Ninety-nine percent of the world's population is made up of other people – why can't we understand them? One of the Fringe's most beloved and thinnest acts offers some suggestions. Complete sell-out 2014-2017.<br/>
										<br/>
										“He sparkles with originality and verve” Chortle<br/>
										“Arrive early for the longest queue in Edinburgh” List<br/>

										<h4>Suzi Ruffell: Nocturnal</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/SuziRuffell.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Suzi is going back to the fringe with a brand new show! Her last show was a complete sell out, got heaps of great reviews and was recommended by the British Comedy Guide, The Scotsman and The Sunday Times. It's important to remember that this is a work-in-progress so it won't be that good but will have moments that you’ll really enjoy! As seen on BBC, Channel 4, ITV, Dave, Comedy Central and the 249 bus to East London where she lives. She also has a cat, she may discuss this.<br/>

										<h4>Steen Raskopoulos: Stay</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/SteenRaskopoulos.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The electrifying new show from the gifted character comedian and improviser. Nominated for both the prestigious Barry Award and Edinburgh Comedy Awards Best Newcomer, Steen's live shows are a “triple threat of performance, material and charisma. A flawless hour of comedy” ★★★★★ (Herald). As seen on Top Coppers (BBC Three), Whose Line is it Anyway? (ABC Australia) and Steen Raskopoulos' Scare BnB (Sky).<br/>
										<br/>
										“Unique and completely hilarious and life-affirming” ★★★★★ New European<br/>
										“Technically astonishing and emotionally fulfilling” ★★★★★ List<br/>
										“An inspired and utterly original stand-up” ★★★★ Sunday Times<br/>

										<h4>Sofie Hagen Does Something (Not A Show Yet)</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/SofieHagen.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										If a show is defined by 'a person is on a stage and occasionally says words' then oh boy, this will be a show alright. If you like people saying words, then this is the show for you. If you are expecting jokes, structure and flawless delivery, you will be gravely disappointed.<br/>

										<h4>Lost Voice Guy: Inspiration Porn</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/LostVoiceGuy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										As seen on Britain’s Got Talent, BBC New Comedy Award winner and star of Ability (BBC Radio 4), Lost Voice Guy, has unwittingly become an unintentional porn star because of the inspirational memes that are everywhere these days. Come and see why he doesn’t want to be an inspiration because of these stupid memes and why he thinks they’re bollocks. He may not be able to talk but he definitely has something to say and his comedy will leave you speechless.<br/>
										<br/>
										“Laugh-out loud funny” ★★★★ Independent<br/>
										“Savagely funny” ★★★★ Wee Review<br/>
										“Candid & inspiring...consistently hilarious” ★★★★ Broadway Baby<br/>

										<h4>Kiri Pritchard-McLean: Victim, Complex</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/KiriPritchardMcLean.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										You might have seen Kiri on Live from the Comedy Store, or The Russell Howard Hour, or heard her on the Now Show, or the Newsquiz. Or maybe you listen to her hit podcast "All Killa no Filla"? You might have no idea who she is and that's fine too. But what you all need to know is that she's, very quietly been going mad for a few years and to borrow a phrase from Uma Thurman she's been “waiting... to feel less angry”. So, it's time to talk about victims, women, love and lies. You might not even believe her, but she's used to that.<br/>

										<h4>Kieran Hodgson: '75</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/KieranHodgson.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Ask most people to remember the early 70s and they won&apos;t. But for character comedian and tedious party guest Kieran Hodgson they might hold the answer to the biggest question of our time: 'Europe?'<br />
										<br />
										Twice nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award, Kieran returns to ARGComFest with the epic tale of how Britain joined Europe in the first place. An overambitious hour of history, politics and enduring friendship punctuated by stunningly accurate impressions of dead politicians you've never heard of.<br/>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/LauraLexx.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										“One can only hope there’s some life altering catastrophe around the corner for Lexx”, so said one reviewer in 2015. Luckily, the award-winning comedian with “superb material, brilliant delivery and irresistible personality” (★★★★ TV Bomb), has had a breakdown.<br/>
										<br/>
										Laura spent 2017 trying to get through therapy, trying the patience of everyone, and trying unsuccessfully for a baby. She’s done trying now; it’s time to laugh.<br/>
										<br/>
										As seen & heard on Sam Delaney's News Thing (RT UK), The Comedy Club (BBC Radio 4 Extra) & The Jason Manford Show (Absolute Radio).
										<br/>

										<h4>Lucy Pearman: Work-in-Progress</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/LucyPearman.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Harmless nonsense from 2017 Edinburgh Comedy Awards Best Newcomer Nominee Lucy Pearman.<br/>
										<br/>
										Lucy will be trying out a brand new show featuring some nice grapes, probably an apple but more importantly, a worm.<br/>
										<br/>

										Stu's back with some thoughts on how it all works out in the end, and whether anyone cares.<br/>
										<br/>
										A hilarious safari through rare diseases, mishaps with appliances, and the chance to convince your son you've got some sort of backbone.  Taking in ambition, money, a sort of moral autopilot, and whether men as a species are worth saving.<br/>
										<br/>
										A Goldsmith always pays his debts.<br/>
										<br/>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/EmmaSidi.jpg" alt="" /></span>

An original and hilarious show of graceful heroes who are having a bit of a tough time. Includes dancing. As seen on TV (W1A, Pls Like, Climaxed) and as heard on radio (The Now Show, Ladhood, Spotlight Tonight).<br/>
										<br/>
										“A-grade stuff, invigoratingly fresh” ★★★★ Telegraph<br/>

										<h4>Adam Riches Is The Guy Who…</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/AdamRiches.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										…you meet right after you come out of a long-term relationship. He has a nice smile, an easy manner and no car. The Edinburgh Comedy Award winner makes a rare appearance at ARGComFest and an ever rarer appearance in the afternoon with this intimate look at one of the planet’s most deliberate men. As sensitive as soap and twice as slippery. Be aware. Be very, very aware.<br/>
										<br />
										<br />
										“Gloriously funny” ★★★★★ Scotsman<br />
										<br/>
										“Never less than brilliant” ★★★★★ Fest <br/>

										<h4>Eleanor Morton: Great Title, Glamorous Photo</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/EleanorMorton.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Scottish rising star and oddball, Eleanor Morton tries to reinvent herself as the sexy, confident comedian she has always secretly probably been. It will definitely work. Refreshingly silly, offbeat and alternative comedy from an award-nominated person.<br/>
										<br/>
										“The Scottish queen of the alt-com scene” Comedy.co.uk<br/>
										“One of the most exciting rising stars of the British comedy circuit” ★★★★ Young-Perspective.net<br/>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/JordanBrookes.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The Edinburgh Comedy Award Best Show 2017 nominee returns for more loosely-justified nonsense. Critically acclaimed and adored by his peers, Jordan is riding high. There's been so much buzz about him. I've heard he does absurd stuff on stage? Yeah sort of, but it's also very accessible. Apparently, he's a really nice guy in real life too. Yeah he is. Very charming. Yes, very charming. Got a lot of time for him. Shall we give him a go then? Oh, absolutely not.<br/>
										<br/>
										“Wildly entertaining” ★★★★ Guardian<br/>
										“Brookes is a startlingly talented comedian” ★★★★ Scotsman.<br/>

Fresh off her Soho Theatre run, her “powerful debut” (Chortle) 'Hymen Manoeuvre' was “a refreshing hour of finely crafted stand-up” (★★★★ Skinny) garnering her favourable mentions by Sarah Millican and Graham Norton also winning her 'Best Comedy Newcomer' at The Pleasance's Indies Awards. Returning with her much anticipated follow-up, where she explores responsibility, blame and cake, Mok offers a work-in-progress that promises to be “uncensored, unapologetic and... wildly refreshing” (★★★★ BroadwayBaby).<br/>

										After a sell-out Fringe debut, one third of Massive Dad (“Hilarious” Guardian) is back with another show about how we got here and where we're supposed to go next. Armed with an absolutely useless degree in Anthropology, she'll be combining character comedy and story-telling with very intense academic research. Which is surely what everyone wants from their comedy. Tessa has appeared in Birds of a Feather, Damned and @elevenish and would very much like you to come and hang out with her.<br/>

										A joyful return to stand-up for this cult idiot, William is wholeheartedly embracing the Willy he always was. Remarkable stories told in original ways.

Yes, he was in the second series of Broadchurch (the one that didn’t make sense), but no, for the last time, he wasn’t in Horrible Histories (he was in the other one).<br/>
