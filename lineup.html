											<h4>Ivo Graham: Organised Fun</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/IvoGraham.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											After dismantling a barge (<i>Taskmaster</i>), doxxing himself in the Doubletree (<i>Off Menu</i>), and blanking on the 1992 Ipswich Town crest (<i>University Challenge</i>), Ivo ropes his audience into more chaos against the clock. 'Humiliation's your thing, right?' His brother asked him at Christmas, and with the full existential ramifications of that still being processed, he's lining up a show with more risk than ever before (NB: previous shows have broadly been quite low risk). Expect quizzes, tangents and fluster. Best Show/Joke nominee 2019.<br/>

											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/AlisonSpittle.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											Glenn Moore (<i>Mock The Week</i>, <i>The Great American Joke-Off</i>, Absolute Radio) tries out a couple of episodes of his new BBC Radio 4 stand-up series. It'll be him sat on a stool reading out jokes and getting your opinion on them, but he promises it's more fun than that sounds.<br>

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/KieranHodgson.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											In 2020, the world changed forever, as Kieran Hodgson moved to Scotland. Now the three-time Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee is taking the high road/West Coast mainline to ARG from his new home of Glasgow to tell you how it's working out. He's that guy from the BBC's <i>Two Doors Down</i> (he's Gordon), the <i>Bad TV Impressions</i> viral videos of <i>The Crown</i> and <i>Happy Valley</i>, and three Channel 4 specials.<br/>

											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/HeidiRegan.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Join me as I put the fun back into searching for meaning in a chaotic universe, if we agree to spell universe as ‘fun-iverse’ which I believe we agreed to. This is a show about Santa, the Matrix, my patient wife... and other fictional concepts, heyooo! No, seriously she is a wonderful person. Winner of the BBC New Comedy Award (me, not my wife) and So You Think You’re Funny, host of two Radio 4 specials and tour support for Joe Lycett, Phil Wang and more.<br/>

											<h4>Jordan Brookes: Snakes for Cats to Watch</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/JordanBrookes.png" alt="" /></span>
											A while back, I found a video online of an animated snake crawling, made for entertaining cats. My cat got bored, but I carried on watching. I was transfixed. I'd like to recreate that experience for you. For an hour, all I'll be is a snake (man) for cats (people) to watch. (I cannot emphasise enough how this is not finished yet. Come along if you like things that aren't yet what they could be).<br/>

											“Sublime lack of self-awareness” ★★★★★ <i>List</i><br/>

											<br/>

											<br/>

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/StephenBailey.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Star of BBC’s <i>Live at the Apollo</i> & <i>Would I Lie To You?</i>, comedian and TV’s Stephen Bailey makes a very welcome return to the stage with his brand new live show, CRASS.<br/>
											<br/>
											From a working-class background in Manchester, six years working at Sainsbury’s, many a carvery and putting his hometown Denton on the map, a lot has changed for Stephen who is five years deep into a relationship, bought a home, become an uncle and climbed his way to the middle of the showbiz ladder – proving why he’s much more than a crass act.<br/>
											<br/>
											Stephen has appeared on shows including <i>Coronation St</i> (ITV), <i>Tipping Point Lucky Stars</i> (ITV), <i>Richard Osman’s House of Games</i> (BBC), <i>Unbreakable</i> (BBC) and presented shows including <i>Celebs on the Farm</i> (C5) and <i>Takeshi’s Castle</i> (Comedy Central).<br/>
											<br/>
											“He’s an arch-bitch with a winning smile, everyone’s favourite gay best friend. Bailey’s confident, funny and suitably rude” <i>The Reviews Hub</i><br/>											
											“Bailey has a natural chemistry with his audience and this is where he truly comes into his own” <i>Broadway Baby</i><br/>
											“A natural talent for making audiences laugh” <i>Metro</i><br/>
											“A rising star” <i>Sun</i><br/>
											“A guilty pleasure” <i>Daily Record</i><br/>
											“Stephen's show was hilarious from the first line, and for the whole performance, I don't think a single joke died” <i>Voice Magazine</i><br/>

											<h4>Chloe Petts: If You Can't Say Anything Nice</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/ChloePetts.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Fresh from her Edinburgh Fringe sellout debut, Chloe Petts returns with her follow up hour. Everyone complimented her on how polite she was with big issues in the last show so now she’s cashing in those points and plans on being really rude. Expect routines on Greta Thunberg, the Queen and calling you all a bunch of virgins.<br/>
											<br/>

											<h4>Spencer Jones: Making Friends</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/SpencerJones.png" alt="" /></span>
											How would I currently describe my show? About 60 percent ready, with enough decent stuff to make it funny, but also enough failures and mistakes to give it that 'never going to happen again' feel. I'm driving all the way from Devon for this. Yeah you heard me. Devon.
											</p></div>
											
											<h4>Thanyia Moore: August</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/ThanyiaMoore.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											After 10 years of comedy, Thanyia was finally set to do her long awaited, anticipated debut hour at Edinburgh festival fringe. Everything was going to plan, until August came. A month that was forecasted to be bright and sunny, became dark and grey, and it took every bit of strength that Thanyia had, to make it through.<br/>
											<br/>
											From running around Edinburgh, to hospital visits, all whilst being triggered by strangers who review you &mdash; Thanyia&apos;s month was not the 'norm'.<br/>
											<br/>
											A show about mental strength, the female body and how awesome the NHS is in Scotland!<br/>

											Bilal Zafar, nominated for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Fringe and winner of New Act of the Year 2016, is back with a brand-new show about how his usually stress-free house share took a turn and his housemate tried to get him arrested several times. He has appeared on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Radio 4 and built up his own online audience on Twitch as he plays an unhinged football manager in an ongoing improvised series.<br/>
											<br/>
