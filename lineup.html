										<h4>James Acaster: COLD LASAGNE HATE MYSELF 1999</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/JamesAcaster.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										James Acaster talks about the best year of his life and the worst year of his life and tries to connect with you.<br/>

										<h4>Lou Sanders: Shame Pig</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/LouSanders.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Yes, big topics are discussed. Her labia, for one. But also shame, sobriety and unrequested sex. Sanders has met some pigs – and been a mucky little pig herself – and now she’s rolling around in her own filth for your delight.<br/>
										<br/>
										As seen on Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled, The Russell Howard Hour, Comic Relief and heard on Radio 4’s The Unbelievable Truth. Lou has written for 8 Out Of 10 Cats, Mock The Week and Miranda Hart.<br/>

										<h4>Josh Widdicombe: Work-in-Progress</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/JoshWiddicombe.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Josh returns to ARGComFest with what he thinks will be a very early work in progress show. At the time of writing he has about 10 minutes of stuff but he has some time off to work on it so is hopeful he’ll get there. And, worst case scenario, if he doesn’t have enough he’ll do some old stuff, which will probably be better.<br/>

										<h4>Elf Lyons: ChiffChaff</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/ElfLyons.png" alt="" /></span>
										The Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee (Best Show 2017) presents her one-woman musical about the economy. You read that right. Let’s get fiscal. The queen of clown is back and she’s making the dismal science fun with a whole orchestra and an Invisible Hand. BBC New Talent Hotlist 2017. Fringe World Best Comedy Show 2018 nominee. British Vogue's '20 Names of Now'.<br/>

										“Hysterical tour de force” ★★★★★ Three Weeks<br/>
										“A fantastic comedic success” ★★★★ Fest<br/>

										<h4>Kieran Hodgson: '75</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/KieranHodgson.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Ask most people to remember the early 70s and they won&apos;t. But for character comedian and tedious party guest Kieran Hodgson they might hold the answer to the biggest question of our time: 'Europe?'<br />
										<br />
										Twice nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award, Kieran returns to ARGComFest with the epic tale of how Britain joined Europe in the first place. An overambitious hour of history, politics and enduring friendship punctuated by stunningly accurate impressions of dead politicians you've never heard of.<br/>

										<h4>Suzi Ruffell: Nocturnal</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/SuziRuffell.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Suzi is going back to the fringe with a brand new show! Her last show was a complete sell out, got heaps of great reviews and was recommended by the British Comedy Guide, The Scotsman and The Sunday Times. It's important to remember that this is a work-in-progress so it won't be that good but will have moments that you’ll really enjoy! As seen on BBC, Channel 4, ITV, Dave, Comedy Central and the 249 bus to East London where she lives. She also has a cat, she may discuss this.<br/>

										<h4>Stuart Goldsmith - Work-in-Progress</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/StuartGoldsmith.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Stu's back with some thoughts on how it all works out in the end, and whether anyone cares.<br/>
										<br/>
										A hilarious safari through rare diseases, mishaps with appliances, and the chance to convince your son you've got some sort of backbone.  Taking in ambition, money, a sort of moral autopilot, and whether men as a species are worth saving.<br/>
										<br/>
										A Goldsmith always pays his debts.<br/>
										<br/>
										“A master of the form” Independent<br/>
										“Makes it look easy” Chortle<br/>

										<h4>Sofie Hagen Does Something (Not A Show Yet)</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/SofieHagen.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										If a show is defined by 'a person is on a stage and occasionally says words' then oh boy, this will be a show alright. If you like people saying words, then this is the show for you. If you are expecting jokes, structure and flawless delivery, you will be gravely disappointed.<br/>

										<h4>Adam Riches Is The Guy Who…</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/AdamRiches.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										…you meet right after you come out of a long-term relationship. He has a nice smile, an easy manner and no car. The Edinburgh Comedy Award winner makes a rare appearance at ARGComFest and an ever rarer appearance in the afternoon with this intimate look at one of the planet’s most deliberate men. As sensitive as soap and twice as slippery. Be aware. Be very, very aware.<br/>

										Harmless nonsense from 2017 Edinburgh Comedy Awards Best Newcomer Nominee Lucy Pearman.<br/>
										<br/>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/EmmaSidi.jpg" alt="" /></span>

										Featured on 'Chris Ramsay's Stand-Up Central' (Comedy Central), Rhys Darby's 'Furious Andrew' (C4) and BBC's New Talent Hotlist 2017, Evelyn Mok  is the best thing to come out of Sweden since… IKEA? Fresh off her Soho Theatre run, her “powerful debut” (Chortle) 'Hymen Manoeuvre' was “a refreshing hour of finely crafted stand-up” (★★★★ Skinny) garnering her favourable mentions by Sarah Millican and Graham Norton also winning her 'Best Comedy Newcomer' at The Pleasance's Indies Awards. Returning with her much anticipated follow-up, where she explores responsibility, blame and cake, Mok offers a work-in-progress that promises to be “uncensored, unapologetic and... wildly refreshing” (★★★★ BroadwayBaby).<br/>

Now Paul has Parkinson’s but he’s still laughing. Following an award-winning BBC documentary, ‘Parkinson’s: The Funny Side’ and a triumphant debut at London’s Comedy Store, here’s a one man show about the therapeutic power of comedy. Paul is not contagious but he is worth catching. <br/>

										<h4>William Andrews: Willy</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/WilliamAndrews.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										A joyful return to stand-up for this cult idiot, William is wholeheartedly embracing the Willy he always was. Remarkable stories told in original ways. He’s daft, inimitably creative, and sharpy ingenuous to boot. Yes, he was in Alan Partridge, for like a tiny bit. Yes, he had a spot in Him & Her. Yes, he was in the second series of Broadchurch (the one that didn’t make sense), but no, for the last time, he wasn’t in Horrible Histories (he was in the other one).<br/>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/OlgaKoch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										In 2014, Olga Koch&apos;s father got stopped by authorities on the Russian border, which resulted in the most surreal year in her family&apos;s life. This year, the Amused Moose National New Comic Award Finalist will try to dissect this real-life spy drama with nothing but a projector and “a naturally comic mind” (Bruce Dessau).<br/>
										<br/>
										Olga Koch does stand-up comedy onstage and creates cathartic performance art in the privacy of her own home. She has trained at the UCB Theatre in New York, as well as the Soho Theatre and the Free Association in London. Along with fellow Soho Young Company comics, she runs Joy Multiplication, a monthly comedy night in London. Olga is a confident girl.<br/>

										<h4>Rob Oldham: Worm's Lament</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/RobOldham.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Rob Oldham, Amused Moose Breakthrough Comic 2017 and tour support for John Kearns and Abandoman, considers politics, youth, and death. He does jokes to ensure this is funny.<br/>
										<br/>
										Worm’s Lament is an hour of stand-up, poetry, reflective nostalgia, and ambient anxiety drawing on Rob’s “Quirky, offbeat sensibilities that distil into smart jokes that rarely sound like anyone else’s” (Chortle).<br/>
										<br/>
										To put it enthusiastically, “You have not lived until you have heard one of Rob Oldham’s tonal prose poems.” (Ed Fest Mag).<br/>
										<br/>
										Don’t miss this debut show from an exciting, thoughtful young comic.<br/>

										<h4>Tessa Coates: Witch Hunt</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/TessaCoates.png" alt="" /></span>
										After a sell-out Fringe debut, one third of Massive Dad (“Hilarious” Guardian) is back with another show about how we got here and where we're supposed to go next. Armed with an absolutely useless degree in Anthropology, she'll be combining character comedy and story-telling with very intense academic research. Which is surely what everyone wants from their comedy. Tessa has appeared in Birds of a Feather, Damned and @elevenish and would very much like you to come and hang out with her.<br/>
										<br/>
										“Real star quality” ★★★★ Chortle<br/>
										“Like a modern day Spice Girl” ★★★★ Broadway World<br/>

										<h4>Helen Bauer: Yellow Flower</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/HelenBauer.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Hotly-tipped new stand up comedian Helen Bauer presents Yellow Flower a show of her new thoughts, feeling and emotions on pretty much everything.

As heard on BBC Radio 4 Extra and seen on BBC3 and Comedy Central UK.<br/>
										<br/>
										“I don’t think I stopped laughing for the entire half hour Helen was on stage. An incredibly likeable comic who takes anecdotal comedy to another level.” Funny Women<br/>
