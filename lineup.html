									<h3>Preview / work-in-progress shows</h3>
										<p>We have announced around half of the festival&apos;s 48 shows. Every single show at the festival is a preview or work-in-progress &mdash; they may be rough around the edges!</p>
										<div id="accordion">
											
											
											<h4>Nish Kumar: THEM CHANGES</h4><div>

											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/OlgaKoch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Olga Koch turned 30, got a master&apos;s degree, went on an adult gap year, got salmonella, lost herself, found herself and washed it all down with a delicious prawn cocktail. Think less Eat Pray Love and more Shake Scream Cry.<br/>

											<h4>Ivo Graham: Organised Fun</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/IvoGraham.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											After dismantling a barge (<i>Taskmaster</i>), doxxing himself in the Doubletree (<i>Off Menu</i>), and blanking on the 1992 Ipswich Town crest (<i>University Challenge</i>), Ivo ropes his audience into more chaos against the clock. 'Humiliation's your thing, right?' His brother asked him at Christmas, and with the full existential ramifications of that still being processed, he's lining up a show with more risk than ever before (NB: previous shows have broadly been quite low risk). Expect quizzes, tangents and fluster. Best Show/Joke nominee 2019.<br/>
											<br/>
											“Motormouthed finesse” ★★★★ <i>Times</i><br/>

											<h4>Kieran Hodgson: Big In Scotland</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/KieranHodgson.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											In 2020, the world changed forever, as Kieran Hodgson moved to Scotland. Now the three-time Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee is taking the high road/West Coast mainline to ARG from his new home of Glasgow to tell you how it's working out. He's that guy from the BBC's <i>Two Doors Down</i> (he's Gordon), the <i>Bad TV Impressions</i> viral videos of <i>The Crown</i> and <i>Happy Valley</i>, and three Channel 4 specials.<br/>

											<h4>Ania Magliano: I Can't Believe You've Done This</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/AniaMagliano.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											To the hairdresser at [redacted] Salon: You can take my money. You can take my dignity. You can take too much off the ends. But you cannot take my right to talk about it every day on stage. <br/>
											<br/>
											This is a show about the worst haircut of Ania Magliano's life.<br/>
											<br/>
											Ania's critically-acclaimed 2022 debut sold out its entire run in a week. She’s supported Marc Maron, Cat Cohen and Ed Gamble, and writes for Amelia Dimoldenberg’s <i>Chicken Shop Date</i>.<br/>

											<h4>Thanyia Moore: August</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/ThanyiaMoore.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											After 10 years of comedy, Thanyia was finally set to do her long awaited, anticipated debut hour at Edinburgh festival fringe. Everything was going to plan, until August came. A month that was forecasted to be bright and sunny, became dark and grey, and it took every bit of strength that Thanyia had, to make it through.<br/>
											<br/>
											From running around Edinburgh, to hospital visits, all whilst being triggered by strangers who review you &mdash; Thanyia&apos;s month was not the 'norm'.<br/>
											<br/>
											A show about mental strength, the female body and how awesome the NHS is in Scotland!<br/>

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/ChloePetts.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Fresh from her Edinburgh Fringe sellout debut, Chloe Petts returns with her follow up hour. Everyone complimented her on how polite she was with big issues in the last show so now she’s cashing in those points and plans on being really rude. Expect routines on Greta Thunberg, the Queen and calling you all a bunch of virgins.<br/>
											<br/>
											“A first show that was worth waiting for” <i>Guardian</i><br/>

											<h4>Celya AB: Second Rodeo</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/CelyaAB.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											As a child, all she wanted was to be an adult. Now she's at the table, she wants out. Following her acclaimed, sell-out debut hour, Celya returns: expect tales of romance, a hologram and a near-death experience in Thorpe Park.<br/>

											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/artists/Sikisa.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Back from doing her acclaimed debut hour, Sikisa is here with a new show and she is worried about words!

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/CerysBradley.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Did Cerys cause their parents&apos; divorce? Did they just make that interaction really awkward? Is a new year's resolution ever going to be enough to fix their personality? In this surreal and silly interactive stand-up show/birthday party, you get to decide. Cerys is a non-binary comedian and Autistic Excellence Award winner at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2022. As seen on BBC One Wales, BBC iPlayer and BBC Radio Wales.<br/>

											<h4>Priya Hall: Grandmother's Daughter</h4><div>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/PriyaHall.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Priya Hall is obsessed with her nan to an unhealthy degree. Her debut show Grandmother’s Daughter is a joyful tribute to one old Welsh lady and the impossible standards Priya has to live up to as she prepares to become a matriarch of her own family. Packed with a level of oversharing that borders on the unhinged, this show promises a healthy dose of queer joy, storytelling and more jokes about sperm than Priya intended.<br/>
											<br/>
											As seen on BBC One, BBC Three, Comedy Central, BBC Radio 4 and more.<br/>

											In her debut solo show, failed child actor and now successful comedian Lulu Popplewell explores the links between <i>Love Actually</i>, smoking crack, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and sunburn.<br/>
											<br/>
											Is love actually all around? Why is addiction more relatable than recovery? Which drug would Mr Bean be most likely to take?<br/>
											<br/>
											None of these questions satisfactorily answered and more!* A daft, rude and thoughtful hour of jokes, actually.<br/>
											<br/>
											*One song.<br/>

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/artists/LeilaNavabi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											Welsh, Brown, Gay, Gen-Z comedian Leila Navabi, (<i>BBC New Comedy Awards</i>) is bringing you a show about how unethical it is to artistically exploit marginalised identities for social gain. They’re ‘the actual future of comedy’ (LMAOnaise) and they have eczema.<br/>
											<br/>
											Following a year that saw her performing at the BBC New Comedy Awards 2022 and writing on projects including <i>Bad Education</i> (BBC Three), <i>Deep Fake Neighbour Wars</i> (ITV) and <i>Never Mind The Buzzcocks</i> (Sky); ‘Composition’ is a work in progress performance of Leila’s hotly anticipated Edinburgh Fringe debut.<br/>
