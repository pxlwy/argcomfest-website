										<h4>Josie Long: Tender</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/JosieLong.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Three-time Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee and very hard to pin down indie-underdog-nightmare Josie Long is back with a new show for the first time in five years. It's about the mind-bending intensity of new motherhood, but mostly about kindness, gentleness, and joy. All in all, the edgiest thing you will see this Fringe. The aim is for you to come out of it feeling optimistic about the future, although that's a big ask. At the very least there will be some really silly voices, and that’s not nothing.<br/>
										<br/>
										“Brilliantly evocative, an original and unflagging spirit” ★★★★ Times<br/>

										<h4>Suzi Ruffell: Dance Like Everyone’s Watching</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/SuziRuffell.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Suzi has made a name for herself turning tragedy and anxiety into big laughs. This year she is happy. This show answers the question, Are all stand ups at their best when they are miserable? Fingers crossed no.<br/>
										<br/>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acts/SianDocksey.jpg" alt="" /></span>

										<h4>Flora Anderson: Romantic</h4><div>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/acts/FloraAnderson.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Ridiculously self-aware middle-class dreamer Flora does a show about trying and failing to be creative in the big city. Is she an epic Romantic vagabond or just an entitled absolute pr*ck? She's chasing a dream, but the chase might be much, much funnier.<br/>
										<br/>
										Debut hour from the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year finalist.<br/>
										<br/>
										“A promising comedian” (Guardian) with a “well-tuned political antennae” (Chortle.co.uk).<br/>
